        <h1>CHAKKA EVERYTHING EXPLODES</h1>
        <h5>A few months ago,The Chakka Tribe defeated the rotten chakkas in battle.It was a long war with thousands of deaths,but the sacrifices were honoured.The chakka population is anonymously booming,money gaining is faster,trades are better,and practically everything went in the right direction.The crimes also went downhill with only 10 neighbourhoods having successful crimes a day,all being petty.Our theory for the crime rate decrease is fear since most criminals as we have seen during the war were a part of the rotten chakka rebellion,and fear our victory.Everything seems well for our tribe so far.</h5>
